### About Me:

<p>I am a computer science engineering student with a passion for cybersecurity, computer networking, and the Internet of Things (IoT). My current focus is on Embedded Systems and I love to work on computer hardware and electronics.</p>

<p>Here on GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests. From cybersecurity tools to IoT devices, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and finding ways to apply them to real-world problems.</p>

<p>As I near the end of my studies, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world problems and make a positive impact on the world. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or learning more about my work, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
